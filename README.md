# hello-world
My first attempt at making a repository


Hi everyone,

I am from Seattle but now live in Denver. I love snow and adventure.  I have no idea what I am doing
but that is okay I will slowly learn.

8-3-21 Wow here is an update, its been quite a few months now, and I have a better idea of how to use Github :)
